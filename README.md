Key Components
1. Main.java
This is the main class where the program starts. It initializes the wallet tracker and trading API and runs the main logic loop for monitoring and trading tokens.

2. WalletTracker.java
This class is responsible for tracking wallets and fetching transactions. It includes methods for getting wallets and their transactions.

3. TradingApi.java
This class contains methods for interacting with the trading API. It has placeholders for buying and selling tokens, which need to be customized with actual API calls.

4. DatabaseManager.java
This class handles database operations. It includes methods for fetching wallets and transactions from a database. Replace the placeholders with actual database queries or API calls.

5. Transaction.java
This is a simple model class representing a transaction. It includes attributes like wallet ID, token type, amount, and a flag indicating if the token was bought.

6. Utils.java
This utility class includes common functions that can be used across the project.

7. Exception Classes
These classes define custom exceptions for handling specific error scenarios:

BotException.java
DatabaseException.java
BlockchainApiException.java
TradingApiException.java
How It Works
Start the Bot: The bot starts by running the main method in Main.java.
Track Wallets: The bot fetches a list of wallets to track.
Fetch Transactions: For each wallet, it fetches recent transactions.
Trading Logic: It checks if a wallet has bought SOL but not HERO, and buys HERO if market conditions are favorable. If HERO is bought, it decides whether to sell based on profit margins.
Execute Trades: The bot interacts with the trading API to buy and sell tokens.
Setup Instructions
Configure Database: Ensure your database is set up and the DatabaseManager is correctly configured to connect to it.
Set Up Trading API: Configure the TradingApi class with the credentials and endpoints of your trading platform.
Run the Bot: Compile and run the Main.java file to start the bot. Monitor the console for any errors or important messages.
Customizing the Bot

Database Operations
Replace the placeholder methods in DatabaseManager.java with actual database queries to fetch wallets and transactions.

java
Copy code
public List<String> fetchWallets() {
    // Implement database query to fetch wallets
}

public List<Transaction> fetchTransactions(String wallet) {
    // Implement database query to fetch transactions for a wallet
}
